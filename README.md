## Purpose and Scope

The purpose of this analysis, was to gather information regarding seasonal trends within Oahu. By looking at temperature information for the months of June and December, we are able to present W. Avy with an idea of business trends at two very different times of year. This allows W. Avy to anticipate whether his shop will operate annually or just on a seasonal basis as dictated by the weather.

## June vs. December; Key Takeaways

Please read the three key takeaways addressed below for a better understanding of temperature differences between the months of June and December. 

### Key Finding 1: Average Temperature's are Relatively Similar

An exciting key finding is that between the months of June and December average temperature only differs by ~3.9 degrees. This means that there is no stark contrast in weather at the two times of year, potentially alluding to the opportunity for year round operation.

### Key Finding 2: Similar Variance From The Mean.

Both months have a standard deviation of ~3.26 and ~3.75. This means that we can expect temperatures to range to above and below the above stated averages by a similar degree.

### Key Finding 3: Minimum Observed Temperature in December is Quite Low.

The largest variance between the two months is the minimum observed temperatures. In December the temperature has dropped as low as 56 degrees, which can lead to a drastic decrease in demand for ice cream and surfing once that low is reached.

## Summary

W. Avy needs to be considerate of the variations of temperature in the cooler months of the year, as these trends may lead to unsuccessful operations. Although in December the mean temperature is 71 degrees, it can drop as low as 56 which has many implications for longevity of operations throughout the month. With this drastic drop it may be best for W. Avy to operate on a seasonal basis when the weather is more favourable.

## Limitations and Extensions

These results look solely at temperature, and do not take into account other important weather conditions such as rain and wind. The first additional analysis that should be performed is to query temperatures throughout the summer months only (June to September). By doing so, W. Avy can anticipate when to expect the temperature to drop so he has a better understanding of what months to open the shop during. Furthermore, warm weather is not the only determining factor of demand for the shop. Once these favourable months have been determined, the precipitation trends for this timeline should be queried to ensure we have warm adn sunny weather - not, warm and rainy. This will ensure W. Avy can best determine the busiest time of year to open up shop.
